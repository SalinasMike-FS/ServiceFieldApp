3.You will be brough to your profile page in whcih you can view your current inventory and enter events
4. entering an event should update the T&R codes for the individual users. 
5. view and enter inventory to keep track of truck stock

known error: The UI keeps disappearing from the inventory. I keep adding a button and it keeps disappearing from the View Controller
known error: T&R codes will add random numbers which wont show any data. adding a condtion here may solve this issue

missing features but will come out in future releases: properly adding the data onto the profile page
clocked in time stamps, proplery editting the trcuk inventory, control over employees as a manager.

bject: this is an app where independent technicians may build their own training tracking to show employers, or the company can manage their employees and assign trucks which can keep track on iventory. much i sneeded for the app to flow better.
